.....Twitter Sentiment Analysis - NLP.....

**Abstract:-
The objective of this project is to detect hate speech in tweets. In other words, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of more then 31k tweets.

**Libraries used:-
